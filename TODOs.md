# TODOs



Code stuff 

- ✅ Get rid of **init** stuff

- ✅ leading underscores for hidden methods 


Text

- ✅ output/outcome/response 

- ✅ Model set-up

- ✅ log likelihood 

- ✅ sklearn

- ✅ multi-class

- ✅ non-linear

- ✅ underline vs. headers for "model set up" and other section labels 

- ✅ In Generative classifiers, maybe change labels to prior and likelihood (rather than p(y) and p(x|y))

- ✅ Link vs. `do this` for dataset names

  

Notation/convention

- "**linear combination**"

- ✅Add a thing to the conventions note about L(theta; data). Note that data might be represented as upper case or lower case

- ✅add a thing about \{ \}_{n = 1}^N

- ✅ Make r.v.s upper case

- ✅ make matrices bold

- ✅ change losses to L

  

Content changes

- ✅ Gradient ascent vs. descent 

- ✅ add mention of linear (no) activation function in NNs

- ✅ Neural nets make $\bx \in \R^{D_X}$ and $\by \in \R^{D_y}$ . 

- ✅ Change wine dataset to cancer in c3 binary stuff
